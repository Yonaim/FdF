# FDF - Wireframe 3D Model Viewer

FDF (\"Fil de Fer\") is a program that reads a map file and visualizes it as a wireframe 3D model. The name \"FDF\" is derived from the French phrase \"Fil de Fer,\" meaning \"wireframe model.\"

## Features

- **3D Wireframe Visualization:** Reads map files and generates interactive wireframe models.
- **Interactive Controls:** Independently manipulate object and camera position, zoom, rotation, and elevation.
- **Orthogonal Projection:** Offers orthogonal projections without perspective distortion.

## Controls

| Control                             | Action                                        |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `Mouse Scroll`                      | Zoom in / Zoom out                            |
| `+`, `-`                            | Adjust object elevation                       |
| `TAB`                               | Switch between OBJECT and CAMERA modes        |
| `ALT`                               | Toggle Axis display ON/OFF                    |
| `W`, `A`, `S`, `D`, `Z`, `X`        | Adjust Position (Object/Camera independently) |

| `R`                                 | Reset all transformations                     |
| `KEY 1~8`                           | Switch between various isometric views        |
| `NUMPAD 1~9`                        | Switch between general predefined views       |
| `F1`                                | Toggle manual/help menu                       |
