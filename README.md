# FDF - Wireframe 3D Model Viewer

FDF (\"Fil de Fer\") is a program that reads a map file and visualizes it as a wireframe 3D model. The name \"FDF\" is derived from the French phrase \"Fil de Fer,\" meaning \"wireframe model.\"

## Features

- **3D Wireframe Visualization:** Reads map files and generates interactive wireframe models.
- **Interactive Controls:** Independently manipulate object and camera position, zoom, rotation, and elevation.
- **Orthogonal Projection:** Offers orthogonal projections without perspective distortion.

## Controls

It's also written in the manual, which you can view by pressing the 'F1' button.

## Libraries Used

- **libft** (custom):
  - A personal C library providing common utility functions such as string manipulation, memory management, and linked lists. Developed for reuse across multiple projects.

- **MiniLibX (mlx)**:
  - A graphical library provided by Ã‰cole 42 for simple graphics rendering, window management, and event handling.

## Installation

Clone the repository and compile using the provided Makefile:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yonaim/FdF.git
cd FdF
make
```

## Usage

Run the executable with a valid map file:
